# LFCInter

a C interpreter that I developed as my master's final learning project a long time ago. After few modifications, I made it compilable in 2021 ... 25 years later :)
Full documentation can be found on my [website](http://destroyedlolo.info/Developpement/LFCInter/)

**Notez-bien** : I'm not expecting to re-work on this old piece of code, I've put it here for education reason only as its parser is well done, calculation is done using uncommon stack method ... 
Now, some basic functionallities are missing (IO, float) to make it very usefull and the interpretor is VERY slow compared for example to PHP as each and every lines are re-parsed everytime it's running.
**But, all in all, I'm quite proude of this old code.**
